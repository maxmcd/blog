I love exploring new projects/code/libraries/websites that people launch online.
I build and launch things from time to time, I enjoy seeing what other people
are up to. I see the structure and decisions they have made and compare it to my
own experience.

These days when I see something new on the internet. I am immediately
suspicious. Did someone make this? How much? How much humanity is in this? If I
like a part of it, or see a familiar pattern, can I empathize with the person
making it, or was this all cooked up by a small number of keystrokes.

There's nothing really wrong with this. I know it is still humans making stuff.
These are new and different tools. I use them too, there are paths to empathy.
Maybe I need to think about how it's connected to humans in a very different
way. I can always go outside and interact with real people.

I liked the very fine details of the internet. I liked to craft and I like to
see the craft of others. Now the internet feels less human, harder to take in
directly. Maybe this has always been the evolution of things, but sometimes I'm
sad about it.
