I love exploring new projects/code/libraries/websites that people launch online.
I build and launch things from time to time, I enjoy seeing what other people
are up to. I see the structure and decisions they have made and compare it to my
own experience.

These days when I see something new on the internet. I am immediately
suspicious. Did someone make this? How much? How much humanity is in this? If I
like a part of it, or see a familiar pattern, can I empathize with the person
making it, or was this all cooked up by a small number of keystrokes.

There's nothing wrong with this. I will go outside more and sit in the park. The
AI can't draw chalk drawings on the sidewalk just yet.

I liked the very fine details of the internet. I liked to craft and I like to
see the craft of others. Now the internet feels less human. We've always known.
Maybe this is always the way it's been, but sometimes I'm sad about it.
