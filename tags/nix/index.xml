      <description>About a year and a half ago I decided to start working on a build system inspired by Nix called Bramble. Andrew Chambers had launched hermes and I was messing around with starlark-go a bit and it seemed like writing a Nix-inspired functional build system with Starlark would be a nice way to better understand how they work.
Bramble is no longer a test project, and has matured into something that I think has a few interesting ideas worth sharing.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently writing a toy Nix/Guix called Bramble to learn more about the inner workings of both systems. One of the features that I wanted to include in my version was &amp;ldquo;binary relocation&amp;rdquo;.
Both Nix and Guix have hardcoded store paths that are baked into all the outputs that they produce. If we take a look at part of a simple nix Derivation you&amp;rsquo;ll see that these paths are hardcoded directly in the file.</description>
