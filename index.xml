      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently writing a toy Nix/Guix called Bramble to learn more about the inner workings of both systems. One of the features that I wanted to include in my version was &amp;ldquo;binary relocation&amp;rdquo;.
Both Nix and Guix have hardcoded store paths that are baked into all the outputs that they produce. If we take a look at part of a simple nix Derivation you&amp;rsquo;ll see that these paths are hardcoded directly in the file.</description>

      <description>tl:dr star is a python(ish) programming environment that lets you call Go library functions. click down to the repl if you&amp;rsquo;d just like to play around
Starlark is Google&amp;rsquo;s custom subset of Python that it uses as a configuration language with Bazel. I started looking into it a little because it has some interesting characteristics. It&amp;rsquo;s not turing complete (no unbounded loops), it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have classes or higher level abstractions, it&amp;rsquo;s also deterministic and is somewhat safe to run untrusted user input.</description>
